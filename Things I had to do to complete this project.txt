1. Database implementation
GOAL: Find a way to attach db into vbnet 

- tried MDF format does not work, 
 - downloaded Microsoft SQL server, 
 - ran into version errors, 957 cannot be used, neet 907 in VBnet

- tried Access DB
 - Microsoft access db did not work, because of driver issue
 - also client may need to download access to use the access DB

- tried simple text file
 - stores data in CSV
 - complicated file object class to manage write and read operations
 - SEE project fitness App
 - future idea: could make own pseudo DB software for FUN!

- tried SQLite ** success **
 - works as a flat file, need to download additional packages into VB
